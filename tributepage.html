		<p>William Shakespeare (bapt. 26[b] April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[c] was an English playwright, poet and actor.
		</p>
		<p>He is regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.
			 He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").
			  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,[e] 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems,
			   and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. .</p>
		<p>Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family.[14] He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.[15] This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616.[16][17] He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son..</p>
		<div>Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.[11][12][f] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres.
			 He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language.
			  In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.

			Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. 
			However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio,
			 a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. 
			 Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, 
			that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".[13]</div>
